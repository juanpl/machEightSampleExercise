# MachEightSampleExercise
This is an algorithm written in python that creates pairs of integers out of a list of integer numbers and a target value. The algorithm created pairs from the numbers in the list, the sum of the elements of each pair being equal to the selected target value.

# Required installations
To compile the file you must download a [pyhton packes](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for you device. NOTE: As a suggestion it is recommended to use a text editor [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (this proyect was created and probe with VSCode editor)

# Instructions for use
1. Download or clone the folder of this project (Sum algorithm)
2. Open the proyect folder
3. The "variables.txt" file is the path to enter the values of the algorithm; open "variables.txt" document, change the values of the list in the line #2, and change the target value in the line #4 of the document (WARNNING: You can remove or put more numbers on line number 2 of the document but you must respect the format that has lines number #2 and #4. If you change the format of the lines or the numbering of the lines, it will generate an error)
4. Compile the "algorithm.py" file
